  # At Cornell University, they have an incredible piece of scientific
  # equipment known as the "tunneling electron microscope."
  #
  # Now, this microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons, you
  # can actually see images of the atom, the infinite decimally minute
  # building block of our universe.
  #
  # Roger, if I were using that microscope right now, I still wouldn't
  # be able to locate my interest in your problem.
